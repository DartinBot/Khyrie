# ðŸ“± PWA Installation & UI Validation Guide

## 1. Test Installation on Multiple Devices/Browsers

### Desktop Chrome
- Open Chrome and go to `http://localhost:8000`
- Look for the install (âž•) button in the address bar
- Click to install; app should launch in standalone window
- Open DevTools > Application > Manifest: should show all icons and metadata
- Check Service Workers: should be registered and activated

### Android Chrome
- Open Chrome on Android device
- Go to `http://<your-computer-ip>:8000` (find your IP with `ifconfig`/`ipconfig`)
- Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt or use browser menu
- Install and launch; app should open full screen

### iOS Safari
- Open Safari on iPhone/iPad
- Go to `http://<your-computer-ip>:8000`
- Tap Share > "Add to Home Screen"
- App should appear on home screen and launch standalone

### Troubleshooting
- If install prompt does not appear, check DevTools > Console for errors
- Ensure manifest.json and sw.js are accessible (no 404s)
- HTTPS is not required on localhost, but is for remote devices

## 2. Validate Offline Mode

### Steps
- Open the PWA in browser and install it

- Try navigating between tabs and using features (workouts, family, etc.)
- Go back online: app should sync any offline actions

### What to Expect
- App loads and works without network
- No network errors for cached pages/data
- Offline status indicator appears
- Data syncs when connection is restored
